# Introduction

This repository contains several video clips depicting the game-play of different autonomous agents in the game of [Frogger](https://github.com/pedrodbs/frogger). 

The agents' behavior was acquired through reinforcement learning (RL).

The video clips correspond to visual explanations produced by an eXplanation RL (XRL) framework. Each video captures a different aspect of an agent's interaction with the environment.

## Structure

- `1-maxima`: all observation maxima
- `2-minima`: all observation minima
- `3-certain`: all certain execution observations
- `4-uncertain`: all uncertain execution observations
- `5-frequent`: all frequent observations    		
- `6-infrequent`: all infrequent observations
- `7-transition-value`: half minima, half maxima
- `8-execution certainty`: half certain-execution, half uncertain
- `9-frequency`: half frequent, half infrequent
- `10-all`: one of each type
- `11-sequence`: sequence from minima to maxima
